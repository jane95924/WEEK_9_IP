## TITLE
 K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS AND NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIERS
## AUTHOR

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
We have two projects, first we predict survival in the famous titanic tragedy and the second is to predict if an email is spam or not.
For our first project, we are given two datasets, test and train dataset. Train dataset has our target variable, survival anf test dataset do not have, which we try to fit in the end of the model.
To predict survival, we use KNN to predict. 
In the second dataset, we use Naive Bayes to classify if a mail is spam or not.

In our experimental design,we did the following

Loaded data and previewed

Data cleaning

Exploratory data analysis

Modelling, used KNN in the first project and Naive bayes in the second project

Hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques.

Conclusion and challenging the solution
